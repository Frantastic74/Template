## Template for GitHub docs
Working on a Word to web template (playing with styles) etc. 
This is a template that mirrors the styles used in GitHub, the new destination of most Teamâ€™s web-based content.
Anyone can have a GitHub account, and you can make private or public, which content you want to share. This guidance is more of how to use this style, in Word form, and also as a WYSIWYG by authoring in GitHub. 

## Applying Headings  
Create Main or Heading 1, by typing # Heading, and the first header above is the 1:1 size of a H1 in Word or Github. Each pound (#) you add will decrease the heading size. Headings 1 & 2 are the 1st types in this document, 3 - 6 appear as follows:  
### Heading 3  
#### Heading 4 
##### Heading 5  
###### Heading 6 
### Format Text elements and styles
Apply the following formatting styles: 

1. **Bold** - For any bold use two asterisks before and after the word. **This is bold text**.
2. *Italics* - For italics, use a single asterisk before and after the word. *This is italic text*.
3. **_Bold & Italic_** - For a combo of bold and italic, use This is **_bold and italic_** text. 

### Lists 
You can have numbered and bullet lists as shown earlier and in the menu options above. 
To create embedded lists, use dashes (-), or stars (*) and 2 spaces before the dash or star (try to be consistent) 

#### Example list: 
- The Envisioning Kick-off guidance is for organizations that have deployed one of the 2 systems: 
  - Skype for Business online or hybrid, or, 
  - Microsoft Teams cloud

Content in the first column | Content in the second column
