## GitHub Template 
This is a template that mirrors the styles used in GitHub, which uses XAML, or markdown language. 
Anyone can have a GitHub account, and you can even use your personal GitHub alias or MSFT alias. If you use your personal account, you must 2FA your account if you are cloning wiht VSTS. 

This guidance is more of how to use this style, in Word form, and also as a WYSIWYG by authoring in GitHub. 

## Applying Headings  
Create headings, by typing the pound symbold, add space and Heading content. A H1 is # <Heading name>, H2 is ## <title> etc.first header above is the 1:1 size of a H1 in Word or Github. Each pound (#) you add will decrease the heading size. Headings 1 & 2 are the 1st types in this document, 3 - 6 appear as follows:  
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3  
#### Heading 4 
##### Heading 5  
###### Heading 6 
  
### Format Text elements and styles
Apply the following formatting styles: 

1. **Bold** - For any bold use two asterisks (** **) before and after the word. **This is bold text**.
2. *Italics* - For italics, use a single asterisk (* *) before and after the word. *This is italic text*.
3. **_Bold & Italic_** - For a combo of bold and italic (**_ **_), use This is **_bold and italic_** text. 

## Lists 
You can have numbered and bullet lists as shown earlier and in the menu options above. 
To create embedded lists, use dashes (-), or stars (*) and 2 spaces before the dash or star (try to be consistent)
